HTTP/2 is binary instead of textual like HTTP1.x â€“ this makes it transfer and parsing of data over HTTP/2 inherently more machine-friendly, thus faster, more efficient and less error prone.
HTTP/2 is fully multiplexed allowing multiple files and requests to be transferred at the same time, as opposed to HTTP1.x which only accepted one single request / connection at a time.
HTTP/2 uses the same connection for transferring different files and requests, avoiding the heavy operation of opening a new connection for every file which needs to be transferred between a client and a server.
HTTP/2 has header compression built-in which is another way of removing several of the overheads associated with HTTP1.x having to retrieve several different resources from the same or multiple web servers.
HTTP/2 allows servers to push required resources proactively rather than waiting for the client browser to request files when it thinks it need them.
